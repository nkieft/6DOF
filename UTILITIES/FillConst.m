function const = FillConst()
%FILLCONST fills a vector with some useful physical constants. How epic!

const(1) = 7.2921159* 10^-5; %Earth rotation rate [rad/s]
const(2) = 6378100; %Earth radius [m]
const(3) = 9.807; %Gravity constant [m/s/s]
%NOTE: GRAVITY CONSTANT HAS BEEN REPLACED W/ VARIABLE GRAVITY
